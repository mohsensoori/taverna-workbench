# Docker Taverna Workbench

Taverna Workbench enables you to graphically create, edit and run workflows on your computer.

### Taverna Workbench Bioinformatics

Taverna Workbench Bioinformatics is an edition of Taverna Workbench that includes support for building and executing bioinformatics workflows using bioinformatics data and analytical services such as BioMart and BioMoby.

Taverna Workbench Bioinformatics is equivalent to the Taverna Workbench Core bundled with BioMart, BioMoby, SoapLab and API Consumer plugins.

### Taverna Workbench Astronomy

Taverna Workbench Astronomy is an edition of Taverna that includes support for building and executing astronomy workflows based on Virtual Observatory (VO) services and other REST services.

Deep data inspection and visualisation of results is possible using local connectivity and data sharing with VO software like Aladin and TOPCAT using the SAMP messaging protocol, in addition to support for manipulating and displaying VOTables. Taverna Workbench Astronomy also provides transformation tools based on the STIL tool set and the possibility to execute Aladin scripts and macros. Specific support is also included for use of the VAMDC atomic and molecular data center.

Taverna Workbench Astronomy is equivalent to the Taverna Workbench Core (distributed under LGPL 2.1 license) bundled with the plugins AstroTaverna and VAMDC (distributed under the open source license GPL 3).

### Taverna Workbench Biodiversity

Taverna Workbench Biodiversity is an edition of Taverna that includes support for building and executing scientific workflows targetting biodiversity services.

This edition includes support for service types such as REST Web services, WebDAV servers, command line tools, scripts and user interactions, and adds integration with the BiodiversityCatalogue. Taverna Workbench Biodiversity is used by projects like BioVeL, which provide the BioVeL Portal for Web execution of Taverna biodiversity workflows.

Taverna Workbench Biodiversity is equivalent to the Core edition bundled with the plugins for the Service Catalogue and WebDAV.

### Taverna Workbench Core

Taverna Workbench Core is an edition of Taverna that includes support for building and executing scientific workflows using general service types, such as WSDL and REST web services, command line tools and scripts (R, Beanshell), user interactions, including support for general data formats like XML and spreadsheets. Other editions of Taverna Workbench extend the Core edition to also include domain-specific service supports and other customizations.

Taverna Workbench Core is distributed under the open source license LGPL 2.1.
